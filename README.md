# Classrom Demo Frontend

I've built the frontend UI for an **Online Classroom** site using NEXT.js (React) and Tailwind CSS. This combines a robust React framework with a utility-first CSS approach for a sleek, **mobile responsive**, and efficient user interface.

### Some Assumptions

I have added modal for contact and support button. I mobile screen the side bar is hidden and will appear when the button beside _Basic Mathematics 101_ is clicked
